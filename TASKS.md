# Task Documentation & Workflow

Use this file to track active work items. Each task should be created by copying `TASK_TEMPLATE.md` and filling in the fields. Keep entries concise and status-driven so agents can pick up quickly.

## Status labels
- `backlog` — not started, ready to be picked.
- `in_progress` — actively being worked on.
- `blocked` — needs input/unblocks.
- `in_review` — PR opened; awaiting review/testing.
- `done` — merged/completed; verify acceptance criteria.

## Required fields per task
- Title/ID
- Summary and rationale
- Acceptance criteria (observable behaviors/outputs)
- Definition of done (tests/builds, docs, handoff)
- Owner + branch/PR links when available
- Notes/risks/blockers

## Workflow
1. Copy `TASK_TEMPLATE.md` into a new section below and fill it out.
2. Update status + notes daily; include latest commit/branch if WIP.
3. When opening a PR, link it and restate acceptance criteria in the PR body.
4. On completion, verify acceptance criteria and testing notes, then mark `done`.
5. If handing off, leave next steps, open questions, and any gotchas.
